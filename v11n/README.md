Building
-------
Building this library requires node and grunt. To build it, navigate to the project directory and type `npm install` to install the grunt packages needed. Then, type `grunt` or `grunt human` to produce a human-readable version of the library, or `grunt dist` to produce a minified, mangled version suitable for a production environment. The files are named `v11n.js` and `v11n.min.js` respectively, and are created at the project's top level. All of the other files present in the repository are for development / testing.
